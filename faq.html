					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<ul class="q-a">
						<li>
							<p class="meta q col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">Who can donate a question? </p>
							<p class="meta a col-md-6">Anyone! The City wants to hear from people who live in, work in, or visit Boston. So far we’ve heard from a wide array of people, some as young as 4 years old! </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="meta q col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">What is the timeframe for the Question Campaign?</p>
							<p class="meta a col-md-6">While we’ve collected some questions throughout the fall (nearly 1,000 so far!) the main timeframe will be mid-January through early February. During the final ten days our mobile Question Campaign vehicle will be touring the city- stay tuned for more details!  </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="meta q col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">Can questions be about things beyond public transportation? </p>
							<p class="meta a col-md-6">Yes! Go Boston 2030 is about planning for all kinds of transportation and mobility, not just public transit. Questions about walking, biking, boating, driving, flying, or even skating are all encouraged. There are lots of ways to get around our city. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="meta q col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">What if my question is about services managed by a state agency?  </p>  
							<p class="meta a col-md-6">This planning process is being done in collaboration with the MBTA, MassDOT, and other state agencies. Our goal is to get as wide a range ideas from the public as possible. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="meta q col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">What happens to questions after they are submitted? </p>
							<p class="meta a col-md-6">When someone donates their question, on or offline, it is entered into the Go Boston 2030 database and joins thousands of other questions. The question will appear on the website for others to read and “like.” (We have a moderator to filter for profanity, but all sincere questions are accepted.) All questions collected will then be sorted by theme. In February, community leaders will convene to select the top questions and themes that best represent the entire body of questions. In March we will conduct a public forum where people can learn about the themes and provide new ideas. All of this will provide the foundation for the City’s transportation vision report. </p>
						</li>
						<li><p class="meta q col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">How do I know if my question has been read and incorporated into the plan? </p>
							<p class="meta a col-md-6">If you submit your question online and provide your email address, you will be able to “track your question” through the process. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="meta q col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">What are the dates for public meetings? </p>
							<p class="meta a col-md-6">We will update this site with upcoming meetings and public events. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="meta q col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">What happens after the vision report is complete? </p>
							<p class="meta a col-md-6">The question campaign will help shape the overall vision for our future transportation system. In the second half of 2015, the City will look at what policies and projects will help us make the vision a reality. There will be more opportunities for public input along the way, and we hope you’ll stay involved! </p>
						</li>
						<li><p class="meta q col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">What should I do if I collect questions on question cards? </p>
							<p class="meta a col-md-6">If you collect questions using the cards, please return them using the enclosed envelope by no later than February 9. (We’ll take them sooner if you have them!) Questions must be entered into the database, and then comes the hard work of sorting and analyzing them. For the public input to count, we need to hear it in a timely way. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="meta q col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">Where can people go to find out more information? </p>
							<p class="meta a col-md-6">This website has the latest information about the campaign. You may also contact Alice Brown at: (617) 635-1916 or alice.brown@boston.gov</p>
